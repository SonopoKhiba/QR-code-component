## My process

First
Use HTML to strcture the web page.

Second
Use CSS to style the web page accodinglly, and make sure it works on diffarent screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS for styling 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how scall a web page for different screens. That when you style using CSS, if the element are not listed in a specific way. Some styling doesnt work. I also learned that div is used for larger styling so if i want to make small things like dots its common practice to use span. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<span>I wanted to use div but i found that span is more ideal </span>
```
```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
    #container {
        background-color: #D7E2EF;
        padding: 50px;
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        width: 1000px;
        height: 490px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to be able to know how CSS manipulation works, layaring of elements and which tags are best ideal for which usage like the span.

### Useful resources

ChatGPT helped me with learning the uses of different tags and CSS elements.
